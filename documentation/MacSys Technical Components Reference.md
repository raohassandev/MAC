## Data Flow

### Device Communication Flow
1. User initiates action (e.g., test connection, read registers)
2. Frontend calls API endpoint
3. Backend controller handles request
4. modbus-serial establishes connection to device
5. Data is read/written
6. Response is formatted and returned to frontend
7. Frontend updates UI with result

**Current Status**: âœ… Working for basic operations

**Planned Enhancements**:
- Add caching layer for performance
- Implement retries for unstable connections
- Add real-time updates via WebSockets
- Support for bulk operations
- Better error handling and user feedback

### Profile Application Flow
1. User selects profile and clicks "Apply"
2. Frontend calls `/api/profiles/:id/apply` endpoint
3. Backend retrieves profile and assigned devices
4. For each device:
   - Establishes Modbus connection
   - Writes register values based on profile settings
   - Records success/failure
5. Backend returns results to frontend
6. Frontend updates UI with results

**Current Status**: âœ… Basic implementation working

**Planned Enhancements**:
- Add validation before application
- Support for partial application if some devices fail
- Rollback capability for failed operations
- Scheduled profile application
- Application history tracking
